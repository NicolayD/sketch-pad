A jQuery project for The Odin Project.
From The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

It's a sketch pad that is built using almost only jQuery. The additional things include the basic html structure
and one css file with a single background color property in order to change the div color using the .addClass() function.

I have improvised and made the divs change color not on hover, but on mousedown and drag.
There are occasional glitches related to that, which I'm still unable to explain and resolve. They occur mainly
after quick mouse moves. However, I believe that it is a bit more interesting if the user is able to colour not on hover but on mousedown.
